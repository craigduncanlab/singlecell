# Seurat guides

1 June 2021

This illustrates the internals of a Seurat object, as discussed at Hacky Hour UWA with Jen 1 June 2021.

I've also prepared a version of the Seurat tutorial with an illustration of the Anatomy of the Seurat Object, with some helpful R/Seurat commands on the diagram:

The rest of the guides are a bit wordy, since I wrote them in a stream of consciousness as I worked.   I am working on a more crafted set, and some more pictures.

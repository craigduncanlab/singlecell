# Seurat guides

I've prepared a version of the Seurat tutorial with an illustration of the Anatomy of the Seurat Object, with some helpful R/Seurat commands on the diagram:

[Seurat_AnnotatedTutorial](Seurat_AnnotatedTutorial.md)

The diagram that started this is the sketch I did of the internals of a Seurat object, as discussed at Hacky Hour UWA with Jen 1 June 2021.

The rest of the guides in this repo are a bit wordy, since I wrote them in a stream of consciousness as I worked.   I am working on a more crafted set, and some more pictures.   

Please send me any feedback via github or software[at]craigduncan.com.au

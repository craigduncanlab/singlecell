# Single cell notes and resources

I've made some background notes relating to single cell analysis and the pipeline that often includes Illumina tech and CellRanger software.

The notes are in fairly draft form and will be updated.

The Seurat folder holds notes relating to the Seurat software by Satija lab.  I am only a user of that R package.

The CellRanger golder holds a few notes on file formats that help to understand the matrix file formats that are used as an input to Seurat.

A useful introduction to single cell is also found here:
